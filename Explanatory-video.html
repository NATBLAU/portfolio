               <h2>Description</h2> 
               <p>The most interesting thing about this project was the fact that after making my own research about retirement care market I was able to understand and visualise my customer vision. 
                I have started my work with making deep research about retirement care in England (main competitors, what they offer). Next step was to prepare interview for my customer to discuss his expectations and ideas. After I have prepared a scenario based on the interview with CEO of this company and my previous research. I have also draw first sketches of scenes. Next step was to show this to my customer and agreed final version before moving on to After Effect. I have drawn all elements in the Illustrator and then animate it in the After effects. </p>
